## Conflict Resolution

- âœ… **Fixed**: restaurant-service moved from 8083 to 8087 (was conflicting with user-service)

## Notes

1. All services are configured to run on localhost by default
2. Service discovery is handled through Eureka (port 8761)
3. Configuration is centralized through Config Server (port 8888)
4. API Gateway (8080) serves as the main entry point for external clients
5. Each service can be accessed directly via its assigned port for testing/debugging

## How to Start Services

```powershell
# Start infrastructure services first
cd config-server; mvn spring-boot:run &
cd service-registry; mvn spring-boot:run &

# Start core services
cd api-gateway; mvn spring-boot:run &
cd auth-service; mvn spring-boot:run &
cd user-service; mvn spring-boot:run &

# Start other services as needed
cd [service-name]; mvn spring-boot:run &
```
